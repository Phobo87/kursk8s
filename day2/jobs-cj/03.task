Create 2 pods with mounted volume to hostPath (same as cronjob created before).
Pods should be named po-writer and po-reader
Make sure cronjob and 2 pods run on the same k8s worker
po-writer should append current date to mounted file every 2 sec
po-reader should echo 3 starting lines from that file along with number of lines from that file every 4 sec

Follow logs from po-reader (-f flag) // kubectl logs <pod-name> -f
